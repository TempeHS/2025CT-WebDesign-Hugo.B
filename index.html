<p>There are many things in the world that everyone knows of to some degree, like the works of Shakespeare, that have
    remained relevant for hundreds of years after his death, or famous videogames like Tetris or Mario. But what makes
    these things remain so popular and well known? This website will address a few points of criteria that I view as the

<h2>What Does Timeless Mean?</h2>
<br />
<p>Something being timeless generally means that a substantial amount of people know of it. A good example of this is
    religion, which has been important to humans for a very long time, with many people not only knowing of it but
    believing in it and using it as a moral system. </p>
<br />
<br />
<h2>What Makes Something <strong>Timeless</strong>: Criteria</h2>
<br />
<p>- Having a significant affect on human <em>culture</em></p>
<br />
<p>- Creating a viable and stable career option</p>
<br />
<p>- Being well known for over 100 years </p>
<br />
