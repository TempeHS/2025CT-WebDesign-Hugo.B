    remained relevant for hundreds of years after his death, or famous videogames like Tetris or Mario. But what makes
    these things remain so popular and well known? This website will address a few points of criteria that I view as the
    things that make
    something timeless. </p>

<h2>What Does Timeless Mean?</h2>
<br />
<p>Something being timeless generally means that a substantial amount of people know of it. A good example of this is
    religion, which has been important to humans for a very long time, with many people not only knowing of it but
    believing in it and using it as a moral system. fish fish dhasudhausdgjqwgbdugasdgyiawgduhasuidgawuidgasygd fish

<p>Something being timeless generally means that a substantial amount of people know of it. A good example of this is
    religion, which has been important to humans for a very long time, with many people not only knowing of it but
    believing
    in it and using it as a moral system. Additionally, being timeless describes a state in which a work of art, design,
    or idea remains relevant and valuable over and over again,
    regardless of ever-changing fashions and trends.</p>
